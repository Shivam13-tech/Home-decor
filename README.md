# Dreamspace - Home Decor Web Application

Dreamspace is a responsive home decor web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It provides users with a platform to explore and purchase home decor products.

## Features

- **Product Categorization**: Users can browse products based on categories such as Hall, Kitchen, Bedroom, Balcony, and Bathroom. Clicking on a specific category will display the corresponding products.

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in to the application. During the sign-up process, users are prompted to specify whether they are a buyer or a seller.

- **Seller Portal**: Sellers can access a dedicated seller portal upon logging in. The seller portal allows them to upload new products, view their existing products, and update product information.

- **Cart Management**: Buyers can add products to their cart and manage them, providing a seamless shopping experience.

- **Token-Based Authentication**: The application implements token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure secure and authorized access to protected routes.

- **React Router**: The application utilizes React Router for client-side routing, enabling seamless navigation between different pages. The routing configuration ensures that users can switch between various sections of the application, such as the home page, product categories, cart, and seller portal, without requiring a full page reload.

- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Dreamspace is designed to be fully responsive, adapting its layout and content to provide an optimal user experience across different screen sizes and devices. Whether users access the application on desktops, tablets, or mobile phones, they can enjoy a seamless and intuitive browsing and purchasing experience.
